# SUSTechGAN

Image Generation for Object Recognition in Adverse Conditions of Autonomous Driving

### Abstract

Autonomous driving significantly benefits from data-driven deep neural networks. However, the data in autonomous driving typically fits the long-tailed distribution, in which the critical driving data in adverse conditions is hard to collect. Although generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been applied to augment data for autonomous driving, generating driving images in adverse conditions is still challenging. In this work, we propose a novel SUSTechGAN with dual attention modules and multi-scale generators to generate driving images for improving object recognition of autonomous driving in adverse conditions. We test the SUSTechGAN and the existing well-known GANs to generate driving images in adverse conditions of rain and night and apply the generated images to retrain object recognition networks. Specifically, we add generated images into the training datasets to retrain the well-known YOLOv5 and evaluate the improvement of the retrained YOLOv5 for object recognition in adverse conditions. The experimental results show that the generated driving images by our SUSTechGAN significantly improved the performance of retrained YOLOv5 in rain and night conditions, which outperforms the well-known GANs. The open-source code, video description and datasets are available on this page to facilitate image generation development in autonomous driving under adverse conditions.

**IN THIS WORK**

- We design dual attention modules in SUSTechGAN to improve the local semantic feature extraction for generating driving images in adverse conditions such as rain and night. This method solves the issue that the local semantic features (e.g., vehicles) in the generated images are blurred and even approximately disappeared, and improves the object recognition of autonomous driving.
- We develop multi-scale generators in SUSTechGAN to consider various scale features (e.g., big size generator for global features and small-size generator for local features) for generating high-quality images with clear global semantic features.
- We propose a novel loss function with an extra detection loss, adversarial loss and cycle consistency loss to guide image generation for improving object recognition of autonomous driving in adverse conditions.
